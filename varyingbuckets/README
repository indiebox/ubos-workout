This app is not built as part of the build.
Instead, it needs to be built manually and used for testing manually.

Example sequence:
* BUCKETS=1 makepkg
* pacman -U
* ubos-admin createsite
* Copy files into /srv/http/sites/*/dir1/
* BUCKETS=2 makepkg
* ubos-admin update --pkg <>

Make sure it does not fail here and that the files are still in the directory. Then:

* Copy files into /srv/http/sites/*/dir1/ and /srv/http/sites/*/dir2/
* BUCKETS=1 makepkg
* ubos-admin update --pkg <>

Make sure it does not fail here either, and that the files from dir1 are still there, dir2's are allowed to be missing.
